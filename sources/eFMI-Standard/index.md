# About the eFMI Standard and its licensing

The _eFMI Standard_ is a freely available, open, cross-community and cross-vendor developed standard.

There is not _the_ _eFMI Standard_ but many separate, self-contained, but incrementally-developed improvements, i.e., versions, of it. If it comes to releases of the _eFMI Standard_, we distinguish the [most recent stable](current-stable-releases.md), [candidate-draft](candidate-drafts-of-next-release.md) and [previous stable](old-stable-releases.md) versions. Each _eFMI Standard_ version consists of the actual specification text _and_ accompanying software artefacts the specification text refers to and leverages on for defining how valid eFMUs must look like and what their meaning is. Such accompanying software artefacts are for example the [XML Schema Definitions (XSD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp) for eFMU container manifests; they are distributed under [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). The specification text of each version is distributed under [CC BY-SA 4.0 License (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) as browsable single-page [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and as a printer-suited [Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document. It is important to understand, that any version of the _eFMI Standard_ is the combination of both, actual specification text _and_ accompanying software artefacts the specification text refers to for defining valid eFMUs and their meaning; just the specification text without such referenced software artefacts is incomplete. All versions of the _eFMI Standard_ are therefore distributed as [Zip-archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) including both, specification text and accompanying software artefacts.

All other -- i.e., _not_ part of any actual _eFMI Standard_ version -- software artefacts and tooling provided by the MAP eFMI are released in coordination with _eFMI Standard_ releases (for details about the coordinated release of _eFMI Standard_ and tooling cf. [the release cycle](release-cycle.md)). Such support artefacts and tooling are released under [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). Examples for such support artefacts and tooling are example eFMUs for the varying _eFMI Standard_ versions, the [_eFMI Container Manager_](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-containermanager), [_eFMI Compliance Checker_](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-compliancechecker) and [eFMI crosscheck test cases](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases).

You find support artefacts and tooling under [Resources](../Resources/index.md). The actual _eFMI Standard_ releases you find in their respective sub-categories above (e.g., the [current stable releases](current-stable-releases.md)).
