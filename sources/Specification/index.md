# About the eFMI Standard and its licensing

The _eFMI Standard_ is a freely available, open, cross-community and vendor developed standard.

There is not _the_ _eFMI Standard_ but many separate, self-contained, but incrementally developed improvements, i.e., versions, of it. If it comes to releases of the _eFMI Standard_, we distinguish the [most recent stable](current-stable-releases.md), [candidate-draft](candidate-drafts-of-next-release.md) and [previous stable](old-stable-releases.md) versions. Each version consists of the actual specification text and accompanying software artefacts the specification text refers to and leverages on for defining how valid eFMUs must look like and what their meaning is. Such  accompanying software artefacts are for example the [XML Schema Definitions (XSD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp) for eFMU container manifests. The specification text of each version can be browsed online as a single-page [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) document or be downloaded as a [Zip-archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) with standalone HTML5 pages or as a printer-suited [Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) container. All versions of the specification text are distributed under [CC BY-SA 4.0 License (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Software artefacts accompanying the specification text and that are part of the _eFMI Standard_, like the [XML Schema Definitions (XSD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_intro.asp) for eFMU container manifests, are distributed under [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

All other -- i.e., _not_ part of an actual _eFMI Standard_ -- software artefacts and toolings provided by the MAP eFMI are released in coordination with _eFMI Standard_ releases (for details about the coordinated release of _eFMI Standard_ and tooling cf. [the release cycle](release-cycle.md)). Such support artefacts and tooling are released under [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). Examples for such support artefacts and tooling are example eFMUs for the varying eFMI versions, the [_eFMI Container Manager_](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-containermanager), [_eFMI Compliance Checker_](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-compliancechecker) and [eFMI crosscheck test cases](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases).

You find support artefacts and tooling under [Resources](../Resources/index.md). The actual _eFMI Standard_ releases you find in their respective sub-categories above (e.g., the [Current stable releases](current-stable-releases.md)).
