The [ITEA Magazine Issue 41 (March 2022)](https://itea4.org/magazine/41.html) has a [short article](https://itea4.org/magazine/41/march-2022/by-and-for-end-users.html) about EMPHYSIS and eFMI. Besides the online article, there is also a fancy [printed version](/media/publications/ITEA-Magazine-Issue-41-by-and-for-end-users.pdf).

The article is based on an interview with Oliver Lenord, Zdeněk Husár, Johannes Ultsch (DLR-SR) and Christoff Bürger. It is on a high abstraction level, focusing on EMPHYSIS as a successful _ITEA_ project.
