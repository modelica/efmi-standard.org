[Version 1.1.0](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases/releases/tag/v1.1.0) of the _eFMI crosscheck test cases_ has been released. The release is mostly similar to the previous release, except for targeting the [Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary) instead of 3.2.3.

The release comprises:

 * eFMI 1.1.0: Support library to ease preparing [Modelica](https://modelica.org/modelicalanguage.html) models for eFMI tooling, particularly for embedded table interpolation.
 * eFMI_TestCases 1.1.0: Official MAP eFMI library with test-scenarios for evaluating and crosschecking eFMI tooling.
 * GALEC-examples 1.1.0: Set of GALEC programs intended as GALEC compiler test suite, e.g., to test production code generators.

The release is for the upcoming _eFMI Standard 1.0.0_. The Modelica libraries are based on the [Modelica Standard Library 4.0.0](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary).
