title: v1.0.2 of official eFMI® Test Suite released

[Third public release (v1.0.2)](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases/releases/tag/v1.0.2) of the official eFMI® Test Suite of the [Modelica Association Project](https://modelica.org/projects.html) Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems (MAP eFMI®). The release comprises:
 - `eFMI` Modelica library: Support library to ease preparing [Modelica](https://modelica.org/modelicalanguage.html) models for [eFMI®](https://www.efmi-standard.org/) tooling, particularly for embedded table interpolation.
 - `eFMI_TestCases` Modelica library: Official MAP eFMI® library with test-scenarios for evaluating and crosschecking eFMI® tooling.
 - GALEC-examples directory: Set of eFMI® GALEC programs intended as GALEC compiler test suite, e.g., to test production code generators.

The release is for the upcoming [eFMI® 1.0.0 Standard](https://www.efmi-standard.org/). The Modelica libraries are based on the [Modelica Standard Library (MSL) 4.1.0](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaStandardLibrary).

The _main_ differences compared to the [previous release](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases/releases/tag/v1.0.1) are:
 - Migration to MSL 4.1.0.
 - New `eFMI.NeuralNetworks` package, enabling the modeling of artificial neural networks (NN) in Modelica. All NN components are completely equation-based, leveraging symbolic manipulation and optimization of Modelica tooling and enabling preservation of equation-based tensor-flows as multi-dimensional GALEC expressions, such that the explosion of production code sizes due to scalarized tensor-flows can be avoided.
 - New `eFMI_TestCases.M11_NeuralQVM` example, demonstrating the use of NNs combined with physics-equations (hybrid Modelica model, PeN-ODE: physics enhanced neural ordinary differential equations) to incorporate the unknown non-linearities of the suspension (spring and damper) of a vertical dynamics quarter vehicle model (QVM) used as predictor/virtual sensor.
