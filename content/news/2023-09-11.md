## Update (2023-11-06): eFMI® Tutorial recordings now public available

![eFMI® Tutorial](/media/news/2023-09-11.png)

We had about 50 participants from 20 organizations and the feedback has been great! Close to all participants managed to follow the hands-on, for which we provided a portable Dymola & CATIA ESP with all required tooling like compilers, libraries etc included. Many of the participants got really excited and used the unique opportunity provided by the conference to discuss the feasability of eFMI in their application domain. **We like to thank each participant for joining the tutorial and your kind feedback! And your patients to stay with us for a 2.5h tutorial!**

The tutorial material (recordings and slides) is now uploaded on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/oCDH-8mXeNw) and linked on our [main](/), [publications](/publications/#2023) and [resources](/resources/#Recommended-documentation-and-introductory-material) pages.

The YouTube recordings are split according to the individual tutorial parts:
 - [Part 1: eFMI® motivation and overview](https://youtu.be/oCDH-8mXeNw)
 - [Part 2: Running use-case introduction](https://youtu.be/ghalwWlbSOA)
 - [Part 3: Hands-on demonstration in Dymola and CATIA ESP](https://youtu.be/n-aIFpxDtWE)
 - [Part 4: Live demonstration in TargetLink](https://youtu.be/XeBVj6-_w0Q)
 - [Part 5: Short presentation of further tooling](https://youtu.be/GF_YNonNMYs)

The tutorial covers the current state-of-the-art of available eFMI tooling, including a high-level introduction to the eFMI Standard (Part 1), and a hands-on experience of eFMI technology for selected Modelica example models (Parts 2 & 3). It shows how to configure a tooling workflow from acausal physics models in Modelica down to embedded target code (Parts 3 & 4) and investigates the generated eFMUs and their various intermediate model representations. The focus is on the non-functional quality criteria satisfied by the generated solutions, like traceability within eFMUs, MISRA C:2012 conformance of generated production code and other code quality criteria like static memory allocation and error handling.

If you have any general questions or feedback on what you think we need to improve or also cover in such tutorial, please contact us on our public mailing list, efmi-info@googlegroups.com (no Google account required) or write a private mail to Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com.

## Original post

We are happy to announce that there will be an extensive tutorial on current eFMI tooling and a forum for eFMI discussions at the [15th International Modelica Conference](https://2023.international.conference.modelica.org/), Oct 9-11, 2023, Aachen, Germany.

### eFMI® Tutorial

**Time:** Monday, 09/Oct/2023, 1:30pm--4:30pm (including 30min coffee break)

We are happy to announce that there will be an extensive tutorial on current [eFMI®](https://www.efmi-standard.org/) tooling [at the conference](https://www.conftool.com/modelica2023/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=2). The tutorial will demonstrate the current state-of-the-art of available eFMI tooling. Participants will get a very high-level overview of the eFMI worklflow and a _hands-on experience_ of it for selected Modelica example models. They will configure a tooling workflow from acausal physics models in Modelica down to embedded target code and have a chance to investigate the generated eFMUs and their various intermediate model representations. Besides setting up and experiencing the eFMI workflow, we will also focus on the non-functional quality criteria satisfied by the generated solutions, like traceability within eFMUs, MISRA C:2012 conformance of generated production code and other code quality criteria like static memory allocation and error handling.

**Requirements:** To conduct the tutorial, participants have to bring their own computer with Windows 10 or 11, 64-Bit, x86. All required software -- except operating system -- will be provided to participants via a password protected download, available two days ahead; **please write an e-mail to Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com (MAP eFMI project leader) that you like to participate** to get timely access. It would be very kind when you download the provided software ahead of time to reduce your preparation time and risk of technical issues at the tutorial. Thank you!

If you have any general questions regarding the tutorial, you can contact our _public_ mailing list, [efmi-info@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/efmi-info) (no Google account required).

### eFMI® forum

**Time:** Thursday, 12/Oct/2023, 9:30am--12:00am (noon).

We are happy to announce that there will be an open discussion panel providing an opportunity to get in contact with [MAP eFMI®](https://www.efmi-standard.org/) and publicly discuss ideas, feedback, requirements and new use cases; or simply clarify any questions you have about eFMI. The forum is an unique chance to get in contact with eFMI experienced tool developers and users and more deeply discuss any ideas you got from the tutorial on Monday.

If you are interested to join, please write an e-mail to:
 - [efmi-info@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/efmi-info) (public mailing list; no Google account required)
 - Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com (private e-mail address of MAP eFMI project leader, if you do not want your mail in public space)
