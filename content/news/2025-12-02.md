We are happy to announce that Daeoh Kang (CEO of [iVH Co., Ltd.](https://www.ivh.co.kr/)) likes to apply as new deputy project leader. Hubertus Tummescheit (former [Modelon AB](https://modelon.com/), now [The REUSE Company](https://www.reusecompany.com/)), our current deputy project leader, changed affiliation a while ago, for which reason Hubertus could not contribute and follow our project as much as he would have liked.

Daeoh is well familiar with eFMI® and Modelica®, promoting its application in industry, like he showed at the [eFMI® tutorial](https://youtu.be/HobYT2BYTL0) at the last [International Modelica & FMI Conference](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/), 2025. iVH offers eFMI® training for Modelica® users in Korea and has been the conference organizer of the last [Asian Modelica Conference](https://modelica.org/events/asian2024/), 2024. In the spirit of the Modelica Association to open itself for Asia, Daeoh is a perfect match to represent and promote eFMI® in the eastern hemisphere.

With Daeoh becoming new deputy project leader, iVH is also stepping up from Advisory Board membership to become a Steering Committee member.
