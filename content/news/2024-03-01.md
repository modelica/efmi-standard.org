The [ITEA Magazine Issue 47 (March 2024)](https://itea4.org/magazine/47.html) has an [ITEA Success story article](https://itea4.org/magazine/47/march-2024/itea-success-story-emphysis.html) about EMPHYSIS and eFMI®. Besides the online article, there is also a nice [printed version](/media/publications/ITEA-Magazine-Issue-47-Success-story.pdf)).

The article is written by Linda van den Borne-Toupet (ITEA) and Christoff Bürger (Dassault Systèmes). It is on a high abstraction level, focusing on the achievements of eFMI since the conclusion of the EMPHYSIS project, particularly the successful official release of industrial-strength tooling.
