Christoff Bürger, Oliver Lenord, Reinhard Heckmann and Zdeněk Husár wrote an article for the [Elektronik](https://www.elektroniknet.de/) magazin special issue for the [Embedded World 2022](https://www.embedded-world.de/en) exhibition. The print version is one of the main articles of the special issue, highlighted on the cover page; an [online](https://www.elektroniknet.de/embedded/software/modelltransformation-und-automatische-codegenerierung.196801.html) version is available too; but it is not as nice as the print version.
