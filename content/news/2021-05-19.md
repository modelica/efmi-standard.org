[LTX Simulation GmbH](https://www.ltx.de/) now is a project partner according to our bylaws. Leo Gall is our contact.

The request of Leo Gall sums up their motivation to apply to become a project partner:

 - LTX would be interested to get access to eFMI repo and mailing list. I.e. we would like to become a project partner according to the project rules. LTX is an organizational member of MA and has signed the MA CLA. Motivation: 
   - For research project UPSIM (https://www.upsim-project.eu/), we would be interested to follow eFMI developments.
   - We want to discuss with BMW how/when/if they want to engage in eFMI project
   - Technically, we are most interested to contribute on the Behavioral Model Manifest, regarding signal comparison in UPSIM project. 
   - The specified CSV reference data could also be aligned to future meta data for Modelica models and MSL reference results.
