The kickoff of MAP eFMI is one of the highlighted news in the official Modelica Association newsletter.

The [article](https://newsletter.modelica.org/2021-01/index.html#map-efmi-kickoff) also links to some of the new promotion material we have. Although it is extracted from the final ITEA3 EMPHYSIS review, it might be interesting for all of you; at least if you need something to show to colleagues or eFMI interested third parties.
