[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://www.merl.com/) (MERL) now is an Advisory Board member of MAP eFMI. Christopher Laughman is our liaison member.

We are very happy Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories joined MAP eFMI. They are already a strong Modelica user with -- besides many other interesting domains -- significant robotics control application research; a perfect fit for eFMI!

Besides Christopher Laughman, also Scott Bortoff joined as projectmen.
