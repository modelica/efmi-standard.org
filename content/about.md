## MAP eFMI members

Development of the _eFMI Standard_ is organised as a [Modelica Association Project (MAP)](https://modelica.org/projects.html) under the roof of the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/). The MAP eFMI has no private individuals as members; only organizations can be a member. The focus of the project is on industrial application of eFMI technology; all members must either actively develop eFMI tooling, use eFMI in industrial projects or consult industrial application.

The project leader and deputy project leader are (contact via efmi-info@googlegroups.com or individual e-mail):
 - **Project leader:** Christoff Bürger (Dassault Systèmes, Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com)
 - **Deputy project leader:** Hubertus Tummescheit (Modelon AB)

The members of MAP eFMI, in alphabetic order, are:

## Project history

The eFMI technology and standardization have been developed in the [ITEA 3 Call 2](https://itea4.org/) research project [EMPHYSIS](https://itea4.org/project/emphysis.html), which won the [ITEA Award of Excellence Special Vice-chairman's award 2021](https://itea4.org/press-release/press-release-emphysis-the-missing-link-between-digital-simulation-and-embedded-software.html). The _EMPHYSIS_ project run from September 2017 until February 2021, consisted of 26 partners from 5 countries, contributing 106 person years budgeted at 13.7 Million €. The final outcome of the project have been the _eFMI Standard 1.0.0-alpha.4 specification_, 11 industrial use cases, 22 _Modelica_ example use-cases with ~40 real time simulation configurations and 13 tool prototypes supporting eFMI, including support in established physics modeling and embedded code generation and analysis tools like [Simcenter Amesim](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/systems-simulation/amesim/) (Siemens Digital Industries Software), [Dymola](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/) (Dassault Systèmes), [OPTIMICA Compiler Toolkit](https://help.modelon.com/latest/reference/oct/) (Modelon AB), [SimulationX](https://www.esi-group.com/products/simulationx) (ESI Group), _SCODE-CONGRA_ (ETAS GmbH), [AUTOSAR Builder](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/autosar-builder/) (Dassault Systèmes), [TargetLink](https://www.dspace.com/en/pub/home/products/sw/pcgs/targetlink.cfm) (dSPACE), [Astrée](https://www.absint.com/astree/index.htm) (AbsInt GmbH), [TPT](https://piketec.com/tpt/) (PikeTec GmbH) and _CATIA ESP_ (Dassult Systèmes).

A good summary of the outcome is given in the public [ITEA 3 EMPHYSIS industrial demonstrator report](/media/resources/emphysis-public-demonstrator-summary.pdf). In the end, EMPHYSIS won the [ITEA Award of Excellence 2021](https://itea4.org/press-release/press-release-emphysis-the-missing-link-between-digital-simulation-and-embedded-software.html), honored with a _Special Vice-chairman award_ title for being one of the highest scored ITEA projects to date:

The results of the _EMPHYSIS_ project have been transferred to the in 2021 founded _Modelica Association Project Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems_ (MAP eFMI), to prepare them for open access standardization and publication and the organization of a volunteer community promoting and developing eFMI. Eleven of the original _EMPHYSIS_ project partners immediately joined MAP eFMI, demonstrating their strong believe and commitment in the eFMI technology.
