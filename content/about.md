# MAP eFMI members

The project has no private individuals as members; only organizations can be a member. The focus of the project is on industrial application of eFMI technology; all members must either actively develop eFMI tooling, use eFMI in industrial projects or consult industrial application.

The members of MAP eFMI, in alphabetic order, are [Altair Engineering Inc.](https://altair.com/), [Dassault Sysèmes](https://www.3ds.com/), [Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.](https://www.dlr.de/), [dSPACE GmbH](https://www.dspace.com/), [ETAS GmbH](https://www.etas.com/en/), [e:fs TechHub GmbH (former name: Elektronische Fahrwerksysteme GmbH)](https://www.efs-auto.com/), [ESI Group](https://www.esi-group.com/), [Mercedes-Benz AG](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/), [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://www.merl.com/), [Modelon AB](https://www.modelon.com/), [Open Source Modelica Consortium](https://openmodelica.org/home/consortium), [PikeTec GmbH](https://piketec.com/), [Robert Bosch GmbH](https://www.bosch.com/) and [Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/).

# Project history

The eFMI technology and standardization have been developed in the [ITEA 3 Call 2](https://itea4.org/) reserach project [EMPHYSIS](https://itea4.org/project/emphysis.html), which won the [ITEA Award of Excellence Special Vice-chairman's award 2021](https://itea4.org/press-release/press-release-emphysis-the-missing-link-between-digital-simulation-and-embedded-software.html). The _EMPHYSIS_ project run from September 2017 until February 2021, consisted of 26 partners from 5 countries, contributing 106 person years budgeted at 13.7 Million €. The final outcome of the project have been the _eFMI Standard 1.0.0-alpha.4 specification_, 11 industrial use cases, 22 _Modelica_ example use-cases with ~40 real time simulation configurations and 13 tool prototypes supporting eFMI, including support in established physics modeling and embedded code generation and analysis tools like _Simcenter Amesim_ (Siemens Digital Industries Software), _Dymola_ (Dassault Systèmes), _Optimica Compiler Toolkit_ (Modelon AB), _SimulationX_ (ESI Group), _SCODE-CONGRA_ (ETAS GmbH), _AUTOSAR Builder_ (Dassault Systèmes), _TargetLink_ (dSPACE), _Astrée_ (AbsInt GmbH), _TPT_ (PikeTec GmbH) and _CATIA ESP_ (Dassult Systèmes).

A good summary of the outcome is given in the public [ITEA 3 EMPHYSIS industrial demonstrator report](../images/about/emphysis-public-demonstrator-summary.pdf).

The results of the _EMPHYSIS_ project have been transferd to the in 2021 founded _Modelica Association Project Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems_ (MAP eFMI), to prepare them for open access standardization and publication and the organization of a volunteer community promoting and developing eFMI. 11 of the original _EMPHYSIS_ project partners immediately joined MAP eFMI, demonstrating their strong believe and commitment in the eFMI technology.
