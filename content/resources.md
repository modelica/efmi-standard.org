[//]: # "# Project resources: Forms, documentation, use-cases and example eFMUs"

This page summarizes all by MAP eFMI published material, most importantly the _eFMI Standard_, but also accompanying documents like example eFMUs, introductory presentations, overview papers etc. For an overview of eFMI tooling, please consult the [Tools page](/tools/). The material published by MAP eFMI and listed in the following can be categorized in:
 1. [eFMI Standard releases](#eFMI-Standard-releases)
    - [Most recent stable release](#Most-recent-stable-release)
	- [Current candidate drafts](#Current-candidate-drafts)
	- [Previous stable releases](#Previous-stable-releases)
 2. [MAP eFMI published tooling](#MAP-eFMI-published-tooling)
 3. [Project organization](#Project-organization): Bylaws, membership application forms, public project reports etc.
 4. [Recommended documentation and introductory material](#Recommended-documentation-and-introductory-material)
 5. [Example eFMUs](#Example-eFMUs)

Example eFMU with Algorithm Code, Production Code, Binary Code and Behavioral Model containers for a drivetrain torque controller. The example and its original [Modelica](https://modelica.org/modelicalanguage.html) model defining the physics of the drivetrain (the plant model) are test case M04 of the [eFMI crosscheck test cases](https://github.com/modelica/efmi-testcases). The embedded controller developed in the eFMU simply is an inverted model of the drivetrain plant model combined with a simple PI controller. The respective Modelica models of the test setup and controller are:

The example eFMU provides the following eFMI containers, each generated by varying eFMI tooling:

 - A Behavioral Model container providing two test scenarios and the original Modelica model defining the controller subject to embedded code generation.
 - An Algorithm Code container providing GALEC code -- i.e., an algorithmic, causal solution -- for the controller; it has been generated using [Dymola](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/) (Dassault Systèmes).
 - 6 Production Code containers for the Algorithm Code container, generated using three different tools: _CATIA ESP_ (Dassault Systèmes), [TargetLink](https://www.dspace.com/en/pub/home/products/sw/pcgs/targetlink.cfm#180_25805) (dSPACE GmbH) and _SCODE-CONGRA_ (ETAS GmbH). With each tool two production codes are generated, a 32 Bit and a 64 Bit floating point precision version. All 6 production codes pass [MISRA C:2012](https://www.misra.org.uk/) checks with [Cppcheck 2.10](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/).
 - A Binary Code container for the 32 Bit production code of _CATIA ESP_, targeting Windows x86 and generated using _CATIA ESP_ (Dassault Systèmes).

[TPT](https://piketec.com/tpt/) (PikeTec GmbH) has been used to validate each production code against the scenarios of the Behavioral Model container. The respective test results are stored in `TestResult` folders of their respective Production Code containers. Minor differences due to floating point precision are visible by the TPT tests; still all 32 Bit compared to 64 Bit floating point precision results are within the tolerances of the test scenarios defined in the Behavioral Model container's manifest.

The final content of the collaboratively developed eFMU is:

Note, that manifests link dependent containers for traceability. Production code manifests, for example, link back to the Algorithm Code container they implement by means of `ManifestReference` and individual `ForeignVariableReference` for each block-variable of the original GALEC code. eFMU consistency between dependent artefacts is ensured by means of SHA-1 checksums. For example, the GALEC code of an Algorithm Code container is listed as `File` element with a mandatory checksum; likewise, the `ManifestReference` of a Production Code container's manifest lists the checksum of the respective Algorithm Code container manifest it implements.

The `schemas` folder contains the XSD Schemas for all manifests as defined in the _eFMI Standard_ 1.0.0. The `__content.xml` of the eFMU's root directory lists all containers of the eFMU; it is the unique entry point for reading and working with the eFMU.
